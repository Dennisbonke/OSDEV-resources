# OSDEV-resources
## Organization
Each resource must be inserted into one of the final layers according on the topic.
The final layers will be broken down into articles, books, talks, and courses, each of which will be separated into a free and paid list.
If a folder is too cluttered, trying to further separate the topics should be attempted.
